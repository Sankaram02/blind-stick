The IoT-based Blind Stick project, integrated with Google and Telegram, is a novel solution that aims to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired people. The project employs IoT technology to integrate various sensors into a standard white cane, enabling it to detect obstacles. 

Moreover, the integration with Google and Telegram allows users to access their Blind Stick using simple voice commands and receive alerts via messaging services. Additionally, the Blind Stick features an SOS button that sends an alert to predetermined emergency contacts, providing an added layer of security to visually impaired individuals.

And we are working on it to integrate with image processing and moreover we got second  and first prices in project expo at our college and an another too.
